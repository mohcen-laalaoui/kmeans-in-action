# 📊 Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering

This project applies K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their spending behavior, age, and annual income. 
It is implemented using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn** in a Jupyter Notebook.

## 🚀 Features
- Generates a random customer dataset
- Applies **K-Means clustering** to segment customers
- Visualizes clusters using **scatter plots**
- Helps identify customer groups for better marketing strategies

## 🛠 Installation & Setup

1️⃣ **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohcen-laalaoui/kmeans-in-action.git
cd customer-segmentation-kmeans
```

2️⃣ **Create a virtual environment (Optional but recommended)**  
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3️⃣ **Run the Jupyter Notebook**  
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Then open **`customer-segmentation-kmeans.ipynb`** in Jupyter.

## 📊 How It Works
1. **Generates a synthetic dataset** with **Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score**.
2. **Applies K-Means clustering** to segment customers into groups.
3. **Visualizes the clusters** using scatter plots.
